Over the next week or so I plan to complete the posting functionality and add rudimentary comments system. I will also try to implement the post voting system. I may not implement voting for comments - only for posts.

All i have left to do is create a mobile friendly version of the site. That is what I will be working on over the next day.
My expected functionality for presentation day is everything i listed in my project proposal.
